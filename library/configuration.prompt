Please write me a configuration.py file that can do the following:

- You write a module with helper functions for a bigger python program (let us call it main.py).
- There is a config.json file in the directory where main.py is also located.
- If the config.json file does not yet exist at application startup, the app will ask the user for a GPT-4 key. The config.json is then written including the GPT4-API-key and the application exits.
- The json-value for the chatgpt key is named "gpt_4_key".
- If the config.json file exists, the app will read the configuration into variables.

Please write helper functions that will:
- Initialize the config.json as given.
- Add a function to retrieve the gpt-4 api key.

Please write the following functions:
```
### `initialize_config()`
The `initialize_config()` method checks if a configuration file already exists. If not, it prompts the user to enter a GPT-4 key and saves this key in a new configuration file. If the file already exists, no action is taken.

### `load_config()`
The `load_config()` method reads the configuration file and returns its content as a dictionary.

### `get_gpt4_key()`
The `get_gpt4_key()` method retrieves the GPT-4 key from the configuration file. It uses the `load_config()` method to read the file and returns the key as a string.
