Please write the code in the following way: 

1. The source code must be capable of achieving the required technical result.
2. The source code should use all available elements not relevant to the first goal, to adhere to the principles of clear communication, thereby preserving its connection to the business problem.

The elements you may use to communicate the connection with the business problem are:
- variable names
- class names
- method names
- the general structure of the code (e.g. how you split it into separate functions)
- comments

The rules are:
- Strings that you use multiple times should be constants.
- Make sure that the elements are used unambiguous and remain connected to the business problem context.
- The code should make sense.
- The connection to the business problem should be convincing "at face value"?
- No intermediate steps shoud be missing

Please write the code in python.Please write me a configuration.py file that can do the following:- You write a module with helper functions for a bigger python program (let us call it main.py).- There is a config.json file in the directory where main.py is also located.- If the config.json file does not yet exist at application startup, the app will ask the user for a GPT-4 key. The config.json is then written including the GPT4-API-key and the application exits.- The json-value for the chatgpt key is named "gpt_4_key".- If the config.json file exists, the app will read the configuration into variables.Please write helper functions that will:- Initialize the config.json as given.- Add a function to retrieve the gpt-4 api key.
